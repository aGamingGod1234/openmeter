# Providers: exactly what OpenMeter reads and calls

One section per provider: which credentials are read from your PC, which
endpoints they are sent to, and what comes back. Each provider's code
lives in [`src-tauri/src/providers/`](../src-tauri/src/providers/) in a
file of the same name — this page is the plain-English version of that
code.

Ground rules that apply to every provider:

- A credential is only ever sent to **its own vendor's API**, over HTTPS.
- If no credential is found, the provider shows a "connect me" hint (new
  installs auto-disable everything undetected except Claude and Codex).
- Expired OAuth tokens are refreshed against the vendor's own token
  endpoint and written back to the CLI's credential file, keeping the CLI
  signed in — identical to what the CLI does itself.

Account and credential safety:

- Every refresh runs through the same account-aware runtime boundary. The
  account's credential source is fingerprinted with SHA-256 for cache
  isolation; credential bytes are never stored in snapshots or the account
  registry.
- Errors, warnings, plan names, and metric text are sanitized before a
  snapshot reaches the disk cache, local HTTP API, CLI JSON, or dashboard.
  Tokens, API keys, email addresses, and Windows user-profile paths are
  replaced with explicit redaction markers.
- The default card reads the normal CLI location. Named cards use a stable
  `provider--account` identity and may point at an isolated credential
  directory or a manually managed key. A credential change invalidates only
  that card's cache.

## Claude (Claude Code)

- **Reads:** `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.credentials.json` (honors
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) — the OAuth token Claude Code saved when you logged
  in.
- **Calls:** `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` (usage windows);
  `platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token` (refresh, written back).
- **Shows:** Session + Weekly windows, per-model weeklies, Extra Usage
  overage; local spend from `~\.claude\projects\` logs. Persisted
  `claude -p` runs count too (`--no-session-persistence` runs write no
  log to read). Advisor work nested in a message's `usage.iterations`
  counts once under the advisor's own model; ordinary iterations stay
  inside the parent totals. Sidechain (subagent) logs that replay the
  parent's message under a fresh request id are deduplicated.

## Codex (Codex CLI)

- **Reads:** `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\auth.json`.
- **Calls:** `chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` (limits, Spark windows,
  credits); `.../wham/rate-limit-reset-credits` (reset credits, and
  `/consume` only when you click Use on a credit); OpenAI token refresh.
- **Shows:** Session/Weekly, Spark windows, credit balance, redeemable
  reset credits; local spend from `~\.codex\sessions\` logs. Child
  sessions (subagent spawns and forks) replay the parent's entire token
  history at spawn — those replayed lines are skipped, so subagent-heavy
  use doesn't inflate spend. Turns that ran on the fast/priority service
  tier (recorded per session in the rollout itself, never inferred from
  `config.toml`) price at each model's Codex priority multiplier, and
  supported GPT-5.4/5.5/5.6 requests above 272k prompt tokens use
  OpenAI's long-context rates for the whole request.

## Cursor

- **Reads:** Cursor's local state database
  (`%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\globalStorage\state.vscdb` — copied before
  reading, never modified).
- **Calls:** `cursor.com` / `api2.cursor.sh` usage APIs; the dashboard's
  usage-events CSV export (for spend).
- **Shows:** credits, usage meters, plan; per-day spend.

## OpenCode (Go plan)

- **Reads:** `%USERPROFILE%\.local\share\opencode\opencode.db` (copied
  before reading) — message costs your own OpenCode history already
  contains.
- **Calls:** nothing — OpenCode has no public usage API (the gateway
  exposes only inference routes); usage is computed locally against
  documented plan limits using OpenCode's real windows: a rolling
  5-hour session (resets as the oldest in-window spend ages out), a UTC
  Monday-start week, and a monthly cycle anchored to your first-ever Go
  usage. **Note the meters count this PC only:** Go quotas are counted
  account-wide on OpenCode's servers, so usage from your other devices
  or from other participants on a shared subscription can't appear
  here. The Console quick-link shows the account-wide truth.

## GitHub Copilot

- **Reads:** gh CLI / Copilot tokens from Windows Credential Manager
  (`gh:github.com:<user>`) or legacy `hosts.yml` files.
- **Calls:** `api.github.com/copilot_internal/user`.
- **Shows:** credits/quota and plan.

## Grok (Grok CLI)

- **Reads:** `%USERPROFILE%\.grok\auth.json`.
- **Calls:** `cli-chat-proxy.grok.com/v1/billing`,
  `/v1/settings`, and `/v1/user?include=subscription`; `auth.x.ai`
  token refresh (written back).
- **Plan:** prefers `subscription_tier_display` from settings, then maps
  `subscriptionTier` from the user endpoint. Plan lookup failures do not
  hide otherwise valid usage data.
- **Shows:** subscription plan, weekly pool, pay-as-you-go cap badge;
  local spend from `~\.grok\logs\`.

## Devin (Devin CLI)

- **Reads:** `%APPDATA%\devin\credentials.toml`;
  `%APPDATA%\devin\cli\sessions.db` (+ WAL/SHM sidecars, copied before
  reading) for local spend.
- **Calls:** Devin's `GetUserStatus` RPC.
- **Shows:** weekly/daily quota, extra balance, plan; local spend from
  Devin CLI sessions (cloud Devin sessions bill ACUs and keep no local
  logs, so they can't be priced).

## MiniMax

- **Reads:** pasted key (Settings), `MINIMAX_API_KEY`, or
  `%USERPROFILE%\.minimax\config.yaml`; local spend from
  `%USERPROFILE%\.minimax\sqlite.db` (the Agent CLI's per-turn
  token_usage table, snapshotted via SQLite's backup API — never
  modified) and from Claude Code sessions that ran against MiniMax's
  Anthropic-compatible endpoint (those log MiniMax models into
  `~\.claude\projects\` and are re-routed here from the Claude card).
- **Calls:** `api.minimax.io/v1/token_plan/remains` (+ regional fallbacks).
- **Shows:** 5-hour Session + Weekly plan windows; Today / Yesterday /
  30-day spend with per-model breakdown (the CLI's own cost_usd is
  preferred; catalog pricing otherwise).

## OpenRouter

- **Reads:** pasted key, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, or the key OpenCode stores.
- **Calls:** `openrouter.ai/api/v1/credits` and `/key`.
- **Shows:** balance, credits meter, key limit.

## Z.ai

- **Reads:** pasted key, env var, or the Z.ai CLI's key file.
- **Calls:** `api.z.ai` quota + subscription endpoints.
- **Shows:** Session/Weekly, monthly Web Searches quota, plan.

## Antigravity

- **Reads:** the running IDE's local language server (loopback), or the
  `gemini:antigravity` token in Windows Credential Manager.
- **Calls:** the local language-server RPC when the IDE runs; otherwise
  Google's Cloud Code quota API (`cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com`) with
  Google's own token refresh.
- **Shows:** Gemini + Claude pool windows, plan.

## DeepSeek / Moonshot / ElevenLabs / Venice-class key providers

- **Reads:** pasted key or env var only (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`,
  `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`/`KIMI_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`). Moonshot
  additionally reads local spend from the Kimi Code CLI's session logs
  (`%USERPROFILE%\.kimi-code\sessions\**\wire.jsonl` — one usage.record
  per turn with model and token buckets).
- **Calls:** `api.deepseek.com/user/balance`;
  `api.moonshot.ai|cn/v1/users/me/balance`;
  `api.elevenlabs.io/v1/user/subscription`.
- **Shows:** balances / character quota with reset pacing; Moonshot and
  DeepSeek add a "Credits used" percent bar metered against the highest
  balance OpenMeter has seen locally (top-ups raise it; feeds the Almost Out
  notification); Moonshot adds Today / Yesterday / 30-day spend, model
  breakdown, and the usage trend from Kimi Code sessions.

## Hermes (spend only — no card)

- **Reads:** the Hermes desktop app's local ledger
  (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\state.db`, `session_model_usage` table — model,
  billing route, token buckets, and the app's own cost per session).
- **Calls:** nothing. This is a purely local spend source.
- **Shows:** each session's tokens/cost in the Total Spend donut under
  the backend that billed it — MiniMax-routed sessions join the MiniMax
  slice, OpenRouter-routed join OpenRouter, anything else appears as a
  Hermes slice.

## Ollama

- **Reads:** nothing.
- **Calls:** your own PC only — `127.0.0.1:11434` (`/api/version`,
  `/api/tags`, `/api/ps`).
- **Shows:** installed models, loaded models.

## Codebuff

- **Reads:** `%USERPROFILE%\.config\manicode\credentials.json` (the
  `codebuff login` file) or a pasted key.
- **Calls:** `codebuff.com/api/v1/usage` + `/api/user/subscription`.
- **Shows:** credits, weekly limit, plan.

## Kilo

- **Reads:** `%USERPROFILE%\.local\share\kilo\auth.json` or a pasted key.
- **Calls:** `app.kilo.ai/api/trpc/user.getCreditBlocks,kiloPass.getState`.
- **Shows:** credit blocks, Kilo Pass window, tier.

## AihubMix

- **Reads:** pasted key (Settings), `AIHUBMIX_API_KEY`, or the `aihubmix`
  key OpenCode stores in its own `auth.json` (AihubMix is typically used
  through OpenCode as an OpenAI-compatible gateway).
- **Calls:** `aihubmix.com/v1/dashboard/billing/subscription` (spending
  limit) and `/usage` (month-to-date usage).
- **Shows:** usage metered against your account's spending limit, plan.
  Requests routed through OpenCode also appear in the Total Spend donut
  from OpenCode's local log, same as any other OpenCode model.
