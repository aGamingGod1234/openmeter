# OpenMeter

**All your AI subscription limits in one liquid-glass tray popover for Windows.**

One click on the tray icon answers the questions every AI power user keeps
asking: *How much of my Claude session is left? When does my Codex weekly
reset? What did today actually cost me?*

## Why OpenMeter

If you use AI coding tools seriously, you're juggling half a dozen separate
subscriptions — Claude Max, ChatGPT/Codex, Copilot, Cursor, and whatever
else this month brought. Each one hides its limits behind its own dashboard,
counts in its own units, and resets on its own schedule. The only time you
find out you're running low is when you hit the wall mid-task.

OpenMeter puts all of them in one place, in your system tray, refreshed every
few minutes, with pace warnings *before* you hit the wall. It is a Windows 11
application derived from [Pane](https://github.com/ItsJazii/pane) and designed
for feature parity with [OpenUsage for macOS](https://github.com/robinebers/openusage).

## Install

Every release binary is built and published by GitHub Actions straight
from the tagged source — public build logs, verifiable provenance.

### One-liner (PowerShell — recommended)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aGamingGod1234/openmeter/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Downloads the latest release, verifies its SHA-256, installs per-user
(no admin), and launches OpenMeter. Read
[install.ps1](install.ps1) first if you like — it's one short, commented script.

### Installer (.exe)

1. Grab **`OpenMeter_x.y.z_x64-setup.exe`** from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/aGamingGod1234/openmeter/releases/latest).
2. Run it. OpenMeter installs per-user to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenMeter` — no admin
   rights needed.
3. Look for the OpenMeter icon in the system tray (next to the clock). Click it.

> **SmartScreen note:** the installer isn't code-signed yet, so Windows may
> show "Windows protected your PC." Click **More info → Run anyway**. Code
> signing is on the roadmap.

Silent install (for scripts): `OpenMeter_x.y.z_x64-setup.exe /S`

The installer also places the `openmeter` command on your user `PATH`.
Open a new terminal and run `openmeter --help`, or run `openmeter --force
claude` to refresh one provider and print the OpenUsage-compatible limits JSON.

OpenMeter keeps itself current after that — every install checks for
signed updates and offers a one-click restart when a new version ships.

### Build from source

Prerequisites: Node.js 20+, Rust (stable-msvc), Visual Studio C++ Build
Tools, WebView2 (bundled with Windows 11).

```
git clone https://github.com/aGamingGod1234/openmeter
cd openmeter
npm install
cd src-tauri
..\node_modules\.bin\tauri.cmd dev     # run with hot reload
cd ..
cargo build --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --release --bin openmeter
cd src-tauri
..\node_modules\.bin\tauri.cmd build --bundles nsis --config tauri.bundle.conf.json
                       # installer lands in src-tauri/target/release/bundle
```

## How it works

OpenMeter is a small Tauri v2 app: a Rust core doing the data work, a vanilla
TypeScript UI doing the glass. No Electron, no background services — one
~10 MB process idling around 90 MB of RAM.

**1. Finding your accounts.** The official CLIs and editors you already use
keep their login tokens in well-known per-user locations — Claude Code
writes `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.credentials.json`, Codex CLI writes
`%USERPROFILE%\.codex\auth.json`, the GitHub CLI stores its token in
Windows Credential Manager, and so on. OpenMeter reads those same files (or
takes an API key you paste into Settings) and shows a card for every tool
it finds. Tools it can't find start disabled — no dead cards.

**2. Asking the vendors.** Every few minutes, each provider's token is sent
to **its own vendor's API only** — the exact usage endpoints the vendors'
own apps use — and the card updates with sessions, weekly windows, credit
balances, and reset times. Expired OAuth tokens are refreshed and written
back, which keeps your CLIs signed in too. Failing providers get benched
briefly and their last good data is shown with an "Outdated" tag instead of
a blank card.

**3. Pacing the burn.** Every metric with a reset window gets a projection:
if you keep burning at this rate, will you make it to the reset? Bars turn
amber/red as the math worsens and optional Windows toasts fire once per
reset window ("Almost out", "Will run out").

**4. Counting the money.** Your CLIs already log every request locally.
OpenMeter scans those logs (Claude, Codex, Grok, OpenCode, Devin CLI, Cursor
CSV, MiniMax CLI, Kimi Code, the Hermes desktop app), prices each
request with live per-model rates (LiteLLM /
models.dev, refreshed daily — hourly while unknown models are around, so
brand-new models price within the hour), and draws the Today /
Yesterday / 30-day donut with a per-model breakdown. Click the ring to
flip between dollars and tokens. On a flat-rate plan this shows what
your usage *would* cost at API prices — the best ad for your
subscription you'll ever see. Requests on models with no public
pricing keep their measured tokens in the counts, but no dollars are
ever guessed for them — a ⚠ on the provider's spend row says the real
cost runs a little higher than shown.

**5. Staying local.** All of the above happens on your machine. There is
no account, and your quotas, spend, and provider data never leave your
PC. Update checks fetch a signed manifest from GitHub. Optional anonymous
daily statistics are disabled by default and require explicit opt-in; see
[Privacy](#privacy--security) for the complete contract.

## Providers (18 and counting)

| Provider | How OpenMeter connects |
|---|---|
| Claude (Claude Code) | `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.credentials.json` + Anthropic usage API |
| Codex (Codex CLI) | `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\auth.json` + ChatGPT usage API, incl. reset-credit redemption |
| Cursor | Cursor's local state database + cursor.com API |
| OpenCode (Go plan) | Local `opencode.db` spend vs documented plan limits* |
| GitHub Copilot | Copilot editor login or GitHub CLI (Credential Manager) + GitHub API |
| Grok (Grok CLI) | `%USERPROFILE%\.grok\auth.json` + Grok billing/subscription APIs |
| Devin (Devin CLI) | `%APPDATA%\devin\credentials.toml` + GetUserStatus RPC; local CLI session store for spend |
| MiniMax | API key (Settings, env var, or CLI config) + token-plan API |
| OpenRouter | API key (Settings) or key stored by OpenCode |
| Z.ai | API key (Settings), CLI key file, or env var |
| Antigravity | Local language server, or Google Cloud Code API via Credential Manager |
| DeepSeek | API key (Settings) → balance |
| Moonshot (Kimi) | API key (Settings) → balance (global + CN endpoints) |
| ElevenLabs | API key (Settings) → character quota with reset pacing |
| Ollama | Local server on :11434 — installed + loaded models, no key |
| Codebuff | `codebuff login` credentials file or API key → credits + weekly limit |
| Kilo | Kilo CLI login file or API key → credit blocks + Kilo Pass |
| AihubMix | API key (Settings or auto-detected from OpenCode) → usage vs spending limit |

*OpenCode has no public usage API yet
([anomalyco/opencode#10448](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/10448));
usage is computed locally from this machine's OpenCode history, the same
data `opencode stats` uses.

More on the way: IDE-database providers (Windsurf, JetBrains AI…) and
whatever the community asks for loudest.

## Features

- **Pace projections** — colored bars and "will run out" warnings based on
  your burn rate within each reset window, plus optional Windows toasts.
- **Local spend** — Today / Yesterday / 30 Days donut with per-model
  breakdown and a 30-day trend, priced with live model rates. Hover a
  slice and it pops out with its legend row; click the ring to flip
  dollars ⇄ tokens.
- **Codex reset credits** — see each banked credit's exact expiry and
  redeem it with one click.
- **Signed auto-updates** — OpenMeter checks for updates every time you open
  it (and every 4 hours in the background); when a release is out, the
  footer version stamp becomes an Update button — one click downloads,
  verifies the signature, and restarts.
- **Live tray numbers** — star up to two metrics per provider and they
  render as logo + percentage pairs directly in the tray.
- **Customize** — drag any card by its grip right in the popover to
  reorder, or open the Customize screen (☰) to reorder metrics, hide
  rows, and tuck rarely-needed ones behind an "On Demand" caret. Ctrl+Z
  undoes.
- **Liquid glass UI** — real SDF lens refraction on the auto-hiding
  sidebar and glass bars, magnetic minimap trail, circular day/night wipe.
- **Share cards** — hover a card, click ⧉, and paste anywhere: a
  collapsed card copies as a clean compact composition, an expanded one
  copies whole (trend, spend, pace hints — buttons and links stripped),
  framed with the OpenMeter icon and tagline.
- **Quick links** — Status / Dashboard shortcuts on every card.
- **[Local HTTP API](docs/local-http-api.md)** — `GET
  http://127.0.0.1:6736/v1/usage` for scripts, Rainmeter widgets, stream
  overlays; same wire format as the Mac app, but with no CORS headers so
  web pages can't read it through your browser.
- **Appearance** — System / Light / Dark, compact density, global shortcut
  (e.g. `Ctrl+Shift+U`), optional outbound proxy.

## Privacy & security

OpenMeter reads credential files. You should not take our word for how it
treats them — verify it:

- **[docs/privacy.md](docs/privacy.md)** — the complete list of every
  network call OpenMeter can make. No event streams, no session recording,
  no autocapture; an opt-in daily statistic can report
  version + enabled providers + refresh success/failure counts under a
  random ID attached to nothing. That document explains exactly how,
  field by field.
- **[docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md)** — per provider: exactly which
  files are read on your PC and exactly which endpoints they're sent to.
- **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** — how to report vulnerabilities
  privately, the security properties you can audit in source, and an
  honest list of current limitations (unsigned installer — the release
  binaries themselves are built by GitHub Actions from the tagged source,
  with public build logs).

The short version: tokens are sent only to their own vendor's API over
HTTPS; pasted keys live in `%APPDATA%\OpenMeter`, readable only by your
Windows user; spend accounting parses your local logs locally; the HTTP
API is loopback-only with no CORS; updates are signature-verified.
